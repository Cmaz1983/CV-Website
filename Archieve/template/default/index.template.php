                    <p>Hi, I’m Colette, thank you for looking at my website… so here is my story so far…</p>

                    <p>In 2008 I was working as a receptionist in a local hotel in St Anne's On-Sea, I gave birth to a beautiful little girl, I remember thinking …this small bundle of joy is going to depend on me for the rest of my life. I was not the brightest at school, I left with poor GCSE grades but regardless of my past, I still applied to <a href="https://www.blackpool.ac.uk/">Blackpool and The Fylde College,</a> hoping that it would mark a first step on my career ladder in teaching. I decided that I would enrol on a Computing course, being an adult student, I was worried I wouldn’t fit in, however, I was pleasantly surprised as the course was for only people over 19.</p>

                    <p>I successfully completed my level 3 qualification and progressed onto the Interactive Media development degree that was offered as a path for progression. The course beyond challenged me but only further confirmed that I wanted to pursue a career in Interactive Media Development. Throughout my time on my courses, the tutors were helpful to me; I began to see them more as friends than just tutors and knew that this was the department that I wanted to have a career in. </p>

                    <p>After successfully completing the BSc Honours Interactive Design (Media) with a First-Class Honours, I secured a lectures position in Computing at Blackpool and the Fylde College, this was my end goal, however, this inspired me to want more. In 2015, I completed my Professional Certificate in Education (PGCE) teacher training. In 2016 I was recognised for the work I was doing and achieved the status of <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/">Higher Education Academy (HEA) Fellow.</a> </p>

                    <p>This recognition gave me motivation to push myself and I decided to apply for a <a href="https://courses.hud.ac.uk/full-time/postgraduate/technology-enhanced-learning-and-innovation-ma">Master’s in Technology Enhanced Learning with Huddersfield University.</a> This course was great for me as I was working fulltime and I only had to attend four taught sessions per year, these sessions were delivered on a Saturday making it alit more flexible for me to learn.</p>

                    <p>After achieving my MSc. I secured a Senior Tutor for Teaching and Learning position in Computing at Blackpool and the Fylde College. This has inspired me to sign up to a new challenge, I am now studying towards a <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/educational-research/phd/phd-in-e--research-and-technology-enhanced-learning ">PhD in E-Research and Technology Enhanced Learning with Lancaster University.</a></p>

                                        Working closely with the relative module leaders and the course tutors,
                                        I am responsible  responding to feedback from students, external examiners, Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies (PSRBs) and industry. I am required to ensure student representatives are allocated to the programme board, and that all students have access to a personal tutor. I have good communication with colleagues across the university and collaborative partners, and with external bodies.</p>

                                        <p>Further to this I was invited to attend the Education Technology Development Group which looks to connect new ideas and technology and identify the most effective and efficient methods of including these in everyday teaching practice. Working as part of Blackpool and The Fylde Colleges’ technology team is a great opportunity and will allow collaboration of research projects with professionals in other departments. More recently my scholarly research has been published internally at Blackpool and The Fylde College in the scholarship review 2016; this research has additionally been submitted to the Research in Learning Technology for consideration for publication.</p>

                                        As a Higher education (HE) and Further education lecturer I teach academic and vocational subjects to undergraduate and postgraduate students aged 16 upwards. 
                                        I Teach methods include lectures, seminars, tutorials, practical demonstrations, field work and e-learning. Multimedia technologies are increasingly used.

                                        As a HE/ FE lecturer I pursue my own research to contribute to the wider research activities of my department. My aim is to have my scholarship published externally in books or scholarly articles. My academic practice and scholarly research (which typically investigates using technology to improve the student experience) has included contributing to a variety of Blackpool and The Fylde College conferences. At the Second Annual Learning and Teaching Conference in 2015 (Scholarship Informed Teaching and Learning) I presented a workshop that demonstrated good practice in using collaborative environments to enhance student participation. Additionally I contributed to Blackpool and The Fylde Colleges’ Third Annual Learning and Teaching Conference (Technology Enabled and Enhanced Learning) where I presented my research into pedagogies that can assist technology enhanced learning.</p>
